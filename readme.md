# Flow Control Library for Node.js

This is a self-written flow control library that currently exports three functions: `Parallel` execution, `Serial` execution and a `Queue` class which allows to add items constantly to the queue. 

It's easy to use and lightweight, but thorough testing is pending. There are many flow control libraries for [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) and JavaScript in general, but in order to get more into Node and server-side JavaScript, I created my own.
